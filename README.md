Movie Recommendation System
===========================

This project implements a personalized movie recommendation system based on user preferences and reviewer feedback.

Overview
--------

The system uses machine learning algorithms to provide tailored movie suggestions to users. It takes into account user ratings, feedback, and the agreement between users and movie reviewers.

Features
--------

-   Personalized movie recommendations
-   User rating and feedback collection
-   Reviewer questionnaire generation
-   Integration of user preferences and reviewer opinions

System Design
-------------

The system consists of four main components:

1.  User
2.  Reviewer
3.  MovieDatabase
4.  RecommendationSystem

For detailed class diagrams and interactions, see the [system design document](resources/system_design/20240716184644.md).

Program Flow
------------

The program flow illustrates how different components interact. For a detailed sequence diagram, refer to the [program call flow](resources/system_design/20240716184644.md).

Implementation
--------------

The project is implemented in Python, using the following libraries:

-   pandas (1.3.3)
-   scikit-learn (0.24.2)
-   Flask (1.1.2)

File Structure
--------------

-   `main.py`: Entry point of the application
-   `movie_recommendation.py`: Contains the recommendation algorithms
-   `user_interface.py`: Implements the Flask-based user interface

Installation
------------

1.  Clone the repository
2.  Install the required packages:

    
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    

Usage
-----

Run the application using:


python main.py



Access the user interface through a web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

API Specification
-----------------

For detailed API specifications, refer to the [API spec document](resources/api_spec_and_tasks/20240716184644.md).

Competitive Analysis
--------------------

Our system aims to provide high user satisfaction and accuracy, positioning itself competitively in the movie recommendation market.

Future Improvements
-------------------

-   Enhance the system's ability to understand complex user preferences
-   Implement more sophisticated machine learning algorithms
-   Expand the movie database and integrate with external movie APIs
